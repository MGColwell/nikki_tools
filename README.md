This script expects `-f <input decomposition sheet filename> -w <wardrobe filename> -o <output filename>`
Your wardrobe file should be a newline-separated list of your wardrobe items spelled
exactly the way the items are spelled in the game.
The decomposition sheet should be a csv export of the original, or an output file from
a previous run of this program.
